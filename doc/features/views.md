# Views
The plugin currently offers two different views:
 - the GreyCat editor, which allows you to define your GreyCat model using a textual domain specific language (see [Language](/features/language.html)). 
 - The structure view, which shows you the structure, i.e. classes and enums and their properties, of your model.
