Your domain model consists of classes and enums, just like in most object-oriented languages. 
Inside classes, you can define attributes and relationships. 
GreyCat distinguishes between two different relationships: relations(rel) and references (ref). 
The difference is that a reference is basically a to-one relation whereas a relation is a to-many relation.
