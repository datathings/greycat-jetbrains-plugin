# Introduction

The GreyCat IDEA plugin for IntelliJ has been developed to ease working with GreyCat models. 
Think of GreyCat models as a typing layer around GreyCat graphs. 
The GreyCat modeling language is a simple language, which allows you to define your application's domain model.
This is where the GreyCat IDEA plugin comes into the game: it gives you a modern editor for GreyCat models.
